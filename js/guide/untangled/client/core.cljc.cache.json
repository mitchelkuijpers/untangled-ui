Note that tempids will have an Om tempid data type.\n  See Om reconciler documentation for further information.\n\n  `:transit-handlers` (optional). A map with keys for `:read` and `:write`, which contain maps to be used for the read\n  and write side of transit to extend the supported data types. See `make-untangled-network` in network.cljs. Only used\n  when you default to the built-in networking.\n\n  `:pathopt` (optional, defaults to true).  Turn on/off Om path optimization.

A map of arbitrary values to be shared across all components, accessible to them via (om/shared this)\n\n  `:networking` (optional). An instance of UntangledNetwork that will act as the default remote (named :remote). If\n  you want to support multiple remotes, then this should be a map whose keys are the keyword names of the remotes\n  and whose values are UntangledNetwork instances.\n\n  `:mutation-merge (optional). A function `(fn [state mutation-symbol return-value])` that receives the app state as a\n  map (NOT an atom) and should return the new state as a map. This function is run when network results are being merged,\n  and is called once for each mutation that had a return value on the server. Returning nil from this function is safe, and will be ignored\n  with a console message for debugging. If you need information about the original mutation arguments then you must reflect\n  them back from the server in your return value.

This defaults to a full recursive\n  algorithm against all data in the app-state, which is correct but possibly slow).  Note that tempids will have an Om tempid data type.\n  See Om reconciler documentation for further information.\n\n  `:transit-handlers` (optional). A map with keys for `:read` and `:write`, which contain maps to be used for the read\n  and write side of transit to extend the supported data types. See `make-untangled-network` in network.cljs. Only used\n  when you default to the built-in networking.\n\n  `:pathopt` (optional, defaults to true).  Turn on/off Om path optimization. This is here in case you're experiencing problems with rendering.\n  Path optimization is a rendering optimization that may still have bugs.\n\n  `:shared` (optional). A map of arbitrary values to be shared across all components, accessible to them via (om/shared this)\n\n  `:networking` (optional). An instance of UntangledNetwork that will act as the default remote (named :remote). If\n  you want to support multiple remotes, then this should be a map whose keys are the keyword names of the remotes\n  and whose values are UntangledNetwork instances.\n\n  `:mutation-merge (optional). A function `(fn [state mutation-symbol return-value])` that receives the app state as a\n  map (NOT an atom) and should return the new state as a map. This function is run when network results are being merged,\n  and is called once for each mutation that had a return value on the server. Returning nil from this function is safe, and will be ignored\n  with a console message for debugging. If you need information about the original mutation arguments then you must reflect\n  them back from the server in your return value. By default such values are discarded.\n\n  There is currently no way to circumvent the encoding of the body into transit. If you want to talk to other endpoints\n  via alternate protocols you must currently implement that outside of the framework (e.g. global functions/state).\n  "]],"~:require-macros",["^ ","^T","^U","^U","^U"],"~:cljs.analyzer/constants",["^ ","~:seen",["^9",["^34","~:untangled/meta","~:remote","^1P","~:children","^2>","~:union-key","~:network-error-callback","~:pathopt","~:untangled/merge","~:networking","~:read","~:key","~:union-entry","~:mutation-merge","~:else","~:config","~:remotes","~:mounted?","~:response-channels","~:migrate","~:transit-handlers","~:steps","~:reconciler","^35","~:original","~:command","~:history","^4=","^33","~:component","^2R","^2=","^37","~:global-error-callback","~:otherwise","~:merge-query","~:request-transform","^2J","~:parser","~:arg","~:send-queues","~:dispatch-key","~:merge-data","~:shared","~:started-callback","^38","~:initial-state","~:union","~:reconciler-options","^36","~:mutate"]],"~:order",["^5E","^5F","^4R","^4S","^4U","^4Y","^54","^53","^5>","^5D","^5H","^5;","^4P","^5:","^4=","^5B","^4Q","^4W","^4X","^5G","^4O","^4V","^5I","^5A","^52","^5?","^51","^56","^4[","^59","^5<","^50","^57","^4Z","^55","^4N","^1P","^33","^34","^2R","^35","^36","^37","^2J","^38","^2=","^2>","^4T","^5=","^5C","^58","^5@"]],"^1:",null]
